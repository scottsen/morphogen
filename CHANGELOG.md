## [0.11.0] - 2025-11-20

### 🎉 MAJOR: Project Renamed to Morphogen

**Breaking Change:** The project has been renamed from "Kairo" to "Morphogen" to better reflect its essence as an emergence-focused continuous-time computation platform.

**Why "Morphogen"?**
- Named after Alan Turing's morphogenesis (1952): simple continuous-time differential equations creating complex emergent patterns
- Aligns perfectly with our architecture: four simple primitives (sum, integrate, nonlinearity, events) composing into emergent complexity
- Unique market positioning: "emergence-focused continuous-time computation"
- Educational value: teaches Turing's morphogenesis while teaching the platform
- See ADR-011 for full rationale

**What Changed:**
- Package name: `kairo` → `morphogen`
- CLI command: `kairo` → `morphogen`
- All imports: `from kairo.*` → `from morphogen.*`
- MLIR dialects: `kairo.*` → `morphogen.*`
- Class names: `KairoMLIRContext` → `MorphogenMLIRContext`
- All documentation updated

**Migration Guide:**
```python
# Before (v0.10.x)
from kairo.stdlib import field, audio
import kairo

# After (v0.11.0+)
from morphogen.stdlib import field, audio
import morphogen
```

**Sister Project:**
- Analog hardware platform "Philbrick" established (named after George A. Philbrick, inventor of modular analog computing)
- Morphogen (digital) + Philbrick (analog) = unified computational vision

### Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive - new domains and operators are now accessible.

### Migration Guide

All 39 domains are now accessible via the `use` statement:

```python
from morphogen.runtime import Runtime

rt = Runtime()

# Chemistry domains
rt.execute("use molecular")
rt.execute("use qchem")
rt.execute("use thermo")

# Fluid dynamics
rt.execute("use fluid_jet")
rt.execute("use fluid_network")

# Audio synthesis
rt.execute("use audio_analysis")
rt.execute("use instrument_model")
```

### Known Gaps

**Integration Examples**:
- Phase 3 domains (fluid_jet, audio_analysis, instrument_model) need usage examples
- Cross-domain chemistry examples needed
- Tutorial content for specialized physics

**Test Coverage**:
- audio_analysis: Smoke tests only (functional tests needed)
- instrument_model: Smoke tests only (functional tests needed)
- Target: 30+ tests per domain based on real use cases

### Next Steps → v1.0

With domain migration complete, focus shifts to:
1. Integration examples for all domains
2. Expanded test coverage (functional tests)
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Documentation polish
5. Community preparation

## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes - 2025-11-23

#### Audio Domain - Filter State Management Fix
**Commit:** `8ab2496` - fix: Export constant operator for registry discovery

**Problem:** The constant operator was implemented but missing module-level export in `audio.py`, causing registry discovery to fail. This resulted in OperatorExecutor returning zeros for the constant operator, breaking filter state tests.

**Solution:** Added single line: `constant = AudioOperations.constant`

**Impact:**
- ✅ Operator count: 59 → 60 (constant operator now discoverable)
- ✅ Filter state test: PASSING (< 1e-6 error, was 0.984786 error)
- ✅ All tests passing: 4 GraphIR state + 4 constant operator = 8/8 ✅
- ✅ SimplifiedScheduler filter_state support confirmed working (no implementation needed!)

**Key Discovery:** SimplifiedScheduler already had complete filter_state support through OperatorExecutor delegation. What appeared to be a missing feature (3-4 hour implementation) was actually a one-line bug. Systematic debugging with reveal and instrumentation found the root cause in 40 minutes.

**Files Modified:**
- `morphogen/stdlib/audio.py` (+1 line)
- `docs/specifications/audio-synthesis.md` (documentation update)
- `tests/test_audio_basic.py` (constant operator tests)
- `tests/test_graphir_state_management.py` (filter state tests)

### Added - Level 2: Domain Registry Infrastructure

**Implementation of Level 2, Phase 1 from Domain Finishing Guide**

We've begun Level 2 (Language Integration) by implementing the core domain registry infrastructure. This is the foundation that will enable all 23 domains to be accessible from `.morphogen` source files.

**New Core Infrastructure:**

- **`morphogen/core/operator.py`** - Operator metadata system
  - `@operator` decorator for marking domain operators
  - `OpCategory` enum: CONSTRUCT, TRANSFORM, QUERY, INTEGRATE, COMPOSE, MUTATE, SAMPLE, RENDER
  - `OperatorMetadata` dataclass: domain, category, signature, determinism, documentation
  - Helper functions: `get_operator_metadata()`, `is_operator()`

- **`morphogen/core/domain_registry.py`** - Central domain registry
  - `DomainDescriptor`: Metadata container for domains
  - `DomainRegistry`: Singleton registry with auto-discovery of operators
  - `register_stdlib_domains()`: Auto-registers all 23 stdlib domains
  - Operator discovery via `@operator` decorator introspection

- **`tests/test_domain_registry.py`** - Comprehensive test suite
  - 19 tests covering decorator, descriptor, and registry functionality
  - All tests passing ✅

**Graph Domain - Fully Integrated (Proof of Concept):**

The graph domain is now the first fully-integrated domain, serving as the template for the remaining 22 domains.

- **19 operators** all decorated and discoverable:
  - **4 CONSTRUCT**: `create_empty`, `from_adjacency_matrix`, `grid_graph`, `random_graph`
  - **11 QUERY**: `bfs`, `dfs`, `dijkstra`, `shortest_path`, `connected_components`, `degree_centrality`, `betweenness_centrality`, `pagerank`, `clustering_coefficient`, `topological_sort`, `max_flow`
  - **4 TRANSFORM**: `add_edge`, `remove_edge`, `to_adjacency_matrix`, `minimum_spanning_tree`

- All operators have complete metadata:
  - Domain: "graph"
  - Category: Semantic grouping
  - Signature: Type information for future type checking
  - Deterministic: All graph operations are deterministic

**What This Enables:**

This infrastructure is the foundation for:
1. `use graph` statements in `.morphogen` files (parser enhancement needed)
2. Type checking of operator calls (type system needed)
3. Auto-generated documentation (tooling needed)
4. IDE autocompletion (LSP integration needed)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Week 1 of 8 for Level 2 (Language Integration)
- 2/23 domains fully integrated (8.7%)
- Infrastructure complete, ready for rapid domain integration

**Next Steps:**
- Add @operator decorators to remaining 21 domains
- Implement parser enhancement for `use` statement

---

### Added - Level 2: Signal Domain Integration

**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Timeline:** Month 3-4, Week 1 of 8

Following the pattern established with the graph domain, the signal processing domain is now fully integrated into the domain registry system.

**Signal Domain - Fully Integrated:**

The signal domain is now the second fully-integrated domain, demonstrating the systematic approach for completing all 23 domains.

- **20 operators** all decorated and discoverable:
  - **4 CONSTRUCT**: `create_signal`, `sine_wave`, `chirp`, `white_noise`
  - **12 TRANSFORM**: `window`, `fft`, `ifft`, `rfft`, `stft`, `istft`, `lowpass`, `highpass`, `bandpass`, `resample`, `envelope`, `normalize`
  - **4 QUERY**: `correlate`, `peak_detection`, `spectrogram_power`, `welch_psd`

- All operators have complete metadata:
  - Domain: "signal"
  - Category: Semantic grouping (CONSTRUCT/TRANSFORM/QUERY)
  - Signature: Type information for future type checking
  - Deterministic: All signal operations are deterministic (except `white_noise` without seed)

**Module-Level Exports:**

All 20 operators are exported at module level in `morphogen/stdlib/signal.py` for automatic discovery by the domain registry system.

**Integration Progress:**
- ✅ Signal domain: 20/20 operators integrated (100%)
- ✅ 2/23 domains complete (8.7%)
- ⏭️ Next: Continue with remaining 21 domains

**What This Demonstrates:**

This integration validates the systematic approach:
1. Add `@operator` decorators to all domain operators
2. Categorize operators semantically (CONSTRUCT, TRANSFORM, QUERY)
3. Export operators at module level for discovery
4. Verify registration and operator metadata

**Related:**
- `morphogen/stdlib/signal.py` - Signal processing operators with @operator decorators
- `morphogen/core/operator.py` - @operator decorator system
- `morphogen/core/domain_registry.py` - Central domain registry
- `docs/guides/DOMAIN_FINISHING_GUIDE.md` - Complete roadmap
- Create operator syntax bindings
- Integration testing across all domains

---

### Added - Level 2: StateMachine Domain Integration

**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Timeline:** Month 3-4, Week 1 of 8

Following the systematic approach established with graph and signal domains, the statemachine domain is now fully integrated into the domain registry system.

**StateMachine Domain - Fully Integrated:**

The statemachine domain is now the third fully-integrated domain, continuing the methodical completion of all 23 domains.

- **15 operators** all decorated and discoverable:
  - **5 CONSTRUCT**: `create`, `create_sequence`, `create_selector`, `create_action`, `create_condition`
  - **6 TRANSFORM**: `add_state`, `add_transition`, `start`, `update`, `send_event`, `execute_behavior`
  - **4 QUERY**: `get_state_name`, `is_in_state`, `get_valid_transitions`, `to_graphviz`

- All operators have complete metadata:
  - Domain: "statemachine"
  - Category: Semantic grouping (CONSTRUCT/TRANSFORM/QUERY)
  - Signature: Type information for future type checking
  - Deterministic: FSM construction/queries are deterministic; operations with callbacks are non-deterministic

**Implementation Details:**

- Added `from morphogen.core.operator import operator, OpCategory` import
- Applied `@operator` decorator to all 15 methods in `StateMachineOperations` class
- Categorized operators by function:
  - CONSTRUCT: Creating state machines and behavior tree nodes
  - TRANSFORM: Modifying state machines, triggering transitions, executing behaviors
  - QUERY: Reading state machine information, visualization
- Marked callback-dependent operations (start, update, send_event, execute_behavior) as non-deterministic
- Exported all operators at module level for registry discovery

**Module-Level Exports:**

All 15 operators are exported at module level in `morphogen/stdlib/statemachine.py` for automatic discovery by the domain registry system:
- FSM operators: create, add_state, add_transition, start, update, send_event, get_state_name, is_in_state, get_valid_transitions, to_graphviz
- Behavior tree operators: create_sequence, create_selector, create_action, create_condition, execute_behavior

**Integration Progress:**
- ✅ StateMachine domain: 15/15 operators integrated (100%)
- ✅ 3/23 domains complete (13.0%)
- ⏭️ Next: Continue with remaining 20 domains

**What This Covers:**

The statemachine domain provides two complementary paradigms for behavior modeling:
1. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Event-driven state transitions with guards and actions
2. **Behavior Trees**: Hierarchical behavior composition (sequence, selector, action, condition nodes)

Both are essential for game AI, UI flows, protocol implementations, and workflow systems.

- `morphogen/stdlib/statemachine.py` - State machine and behavior tree operators with @operator decorators
- `morphogen/core/operator.py` - @operator decorator system
- `morphogen/core/domain_registry.py` - Central domain registry
