# Kairo v0.7.0 Requirements
# Real MLIR Integration Dependencies

# Core Kairo Dependencies (existing)
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# MLIR Python Bindings (v0.7.0 NEW)
# Installation: pip install mlir -f https://github.com/makslevental/mlir-wheels/releases/expanded_assets/latest
# Note: This requires a large download (~500MB+). For development, you may build from source.
# Build from source: https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Bindings/Python/
#
# For now, this is documented but not auto-installed to allow flexibility in setup.
# Developers should install manually using one of these methods:
#
# Method 1 (Pre-built wheels - recommended for quick start):
#   pip install mlir -f https://github.com/makslevental/mlir-wheels/releases/expanded_assets/latest
#
# Method 2 (Build from source - for customization):
#   git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
#   cd llvm-project
#   mkdir build && cd build
#   cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
#     -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir \
#     -DMLIR_ENABLE_BINDINGS_PYTHON=ON \
#     -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;NVPTX;AMDGPU" \
#     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#   ninja
#   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/tools/mlir/python_packages/mlir_core
