- ❌ No case studies or application examples

---

## Strategic Priorities: Why These Matter

### Priority 1: Circuit Domain ⭐ **CRITICAL PATH**

**Why:** Enables groundbreaking circuit→audio demos that no competitor can match

**Strategic Value:**
- **Unique Capability:** SPICE-like circuit simulation → audio synthesis in one platform
- **Target Audience:** Audio engineers, lutherie, synthesizer designers
- **Differentiation:** No other platform couples circuit design with audio rendering
- **Marketing Gold:** "Design guitar pedal circuit → hear the sound instantly"

**Specification Status:** 90% complete (1,136 lines at `docs/specifications/circuit.md`)

**Estimated Effort:** 10-14 days (based on geometry domain precedent)

**Deliverables:**
- `/morphogen/stdlib/circuit.py` (2,000-2,500 lines)
- `/tests/test_circuit*.py` (1,000+ lines, 100+ tests)
- `/examples/circuit/` (5+ examples: RC filter, oscillator, analog synth)
- `/examples/cross_domain/circuit_to_audio.morph` (showcase demo)
- Domain registry updates, documentation

**Success Metric:** Demo video showing "design circuit → simulate → synthesize audio" workflow

---

### Priority 2: Compelling Showcase Examples

**Why:** Attract users NOW with existing 40 domains, demonstrate unique value

**Target Audiences & Their Demos:**

**Education/Academic:**
- Interactive physics sandbox (rigidbody + visual + user input)
- PDE solver workflow (field + sparse_linalg + visual)
- Reproducible research demo (deterministic, checkpointing)

**Audio Production:**
- Real-time audio visualizer (audio ↔ visual synchronization)
- Physical modeling instrument (rigidbody → acoustics → audio)
- Parametric synthesizer with geometry UI

**Creative Coding:**
- Generative art with deterministic particles (agents + visual)
- Procedural terrain with biomes (terrain + cellular + visual)
- Interactive reaction-diffusion (field + cellular + visual)

**Engineering/Enterprise:**
- Digital twin demo (rigidbody + field + optimization)
- Multi-physics pipeline (thermal → fluid → acoustics)

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days (1 day per showcase + polish)

**Deliverables:**
- 5+ showcase examples in `/examples/showcase/`
- Video recordings (30-60 seconds each)
- Blog post explaining each demo
- Updated README "See it in action" section

**Success Metric:** Each demo demonstrates 3+ domains working together seamlessly

---

### Priority 3: PyPI Release & Community Infrastructure

**Why:** Enable external adoption, gather feedback, start building community

**Blocks:**
- External users can't `pip install kairo`
- No clear path for contributors to onboard
- No automated quality checks (CI/CD)

**Tasks:**

**PyPI Packaging:**
- Create `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- Configure automated PyPI release via GitHub Actions
- Test installation in fresh environment
- Prepare release notes for v0.11.0

**Contributor Infrastructure:**
- Write CONTRIBUTING.md (setup, workflow, testing, PR guidelines)
- Create DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (architecture, adding domains, debugging)
- Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Configure issue templates (bug, feature request, domain proposal)
- Set up discussion forum or Discord

**CI/CD Polish:**
- Automated testing on push
- Type checking (mypy)
- Linting (ruff)
- Coverage reporting
- Automated release workflow

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

**Deliverables:**
- PyPI package: `pip install kairo` works
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `/docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- `.github/` templates and workflows
- Community communication channel

**Success Metric:** External contributor submits first PR within 2 weeks of PyPI release

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Circuit domain more complex than estimated** | Medium | Medium | Spec 90% complete, use existing sparse_linalg foundation, budget 2 extra days |
| **MLIR performance bottleneck** | Medium | High | Profile early, GPU acceleration plan exists, LLVM backend proven in Phase 6 |
| **Cross-domain integration bugs** | Low | Medium | Comprehensive integration tests already established, follow geometry domain pattern |
| **Performance targets not met** | Medium | Medium | Benchmarks will reveal reality early, adjust messaging if needed |

### Community Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Low adoption rate** | Medium | High | Compelling demos targeting specific communities (audio, scientific computing), PyPI discoverability |
| **Contributor burnout (solo maintainer)** | Low | Medium | Clear contributing docs, modular architecture enables parallel work, responsive feedback |
| **Unclear value proposition** | Medium | High | Focus messaging on unique cross-domain capabilities, benchmark against alternatives, showcase examples |
| **Fragmented user base** | Low | Medium | Unified documentation, cross-domain examples, community events, single communication channel |

### Mitigation Actions (Proactive)

1. **Circuit Domain:** Start with MVP (basic components + MNA solver), iterate based on feedback
2. **Performance:** Publish benchmarks early, adjust targets transparently if needed
3. **Adoption:** Target specific communities (r/creativecoding, audio production forums) with tailored demos
4. **Community:** Responsive communication, recognize contributors, modular architecture for parallel work

## Resource Allocation (Next 12 Weeks)

**Recommended Time Distribution:**

| Category | Weeks 1-3 | Weeks 4-6 | Weeks 7-12 | Total |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Domain Implementation** | 60% (Circuit) | 40% (Cellular) | 70% (Fluid, Chem) | 57% |
| **Showcase Examples** | 25% | 10% | 5% | 13% |
| **Community Infrastructure** | 10% | 30% | 5% | 15% |
| **Performance & Optimization** | 0% | 20% | 10% | 10% |
| **Documentation & Tutorials** | 5% | 0% | 10% | 5% |

**Rationale:**
- Heavy domain implementation (57%) aligns with strategic priority
- Front-load showcase examples (25% weeks 1-3) for immediate marketing impact
- Community infrastructure spike (30% weeks 4-6) enables PyPI release
- Performance benchmarking (20% week 5) validates competitive positioning
- Tutorial creation (week 12) leverages completed domains

---

## Decision Points

**By End of Week 3:**
- [ ] Evaluate circuit domain demo quality - proceed to fluid or pivot?
- [ ] Assess showcase example effectiveness - adjust marketing approach?
- [ ] PyPI packaging complete - ready for release in week 6?

**By End of Week 6:**
- [ ] Evaluate PyPI release success (downloads, feedback) - adjust messaging?
- [ ] Assess performance benchmarks - invest in GPU acceleration immediately?
- [ ] Decide on primary community channel based on early adopter feedback

**By End of Week 12:**
- [ ] Evaluate tutorial effectiveness - create video versions?
- [ ] Assess community growth - adjust outreach strategy?
