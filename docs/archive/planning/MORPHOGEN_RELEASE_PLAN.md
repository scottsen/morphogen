## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: Symbolic Execution Complexity**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Start simple (1D heat equation), always fall back to numeric
- **Contingency:** Ship symbolic as experimental feature in v1.1

**Risk 2: Timeline Slippage**
- **Probability:** High (aggressive timeline)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Track progress weekly, adjust scope if needed
- **Contingency:** Move plugin system to v1.1, ship v1.0 with core features

**Risk 3: Circuit Domain Takes Too Long**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Focus on DC/AC/transient first, defer advanced features
- **Contingency:** Ship basic circuit in v1.0, expand in v1.1

**Risk 4: User Adoption Lower Than Expected**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Invest heavily in showcase examples, tutorials, marketing
- **Contingency:** Pivot messaging based on early feedback

### Weekly Risk Reviews

**Every Monday:**
1. Review previous week's progress
2. Identify blockers
3. Adjust timeline if needed
4. Communicate changes

**Red Flags:**
- More than 1 week behind schedule
- Major technical blocker discovered
- Critical bug affecting core functionality

**Response:**
- Reduce scope (defer features to v1.1)
- Increase resources (add contributor)
- Extend timeline (communicate to stakeholders)
