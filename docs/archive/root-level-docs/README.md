# Archived Root-Level Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that were originally in the repository root but have been archived to reduce duplication and improve documentation organization.

## Archived Files

### ARCHITECTURE.md
**Reason for archiving**: Duplicated content from `/docs/architecture/overview.md`
**Replacement**: See `/docs/architecture/` for current architecture documentation

### AUDIO_SPECIFICATION.md
**Reason for archiving**: Duplicated content from `/docs/specifications/ambient-music.md`
**Replacement**: See `/docs/specifications/ambient-music.md` for the authoritative audio specification

## Documentation Structure

All project documentation is now organized under `/docs/` with the following structure:

- `/docs/architecture/` - System architecture and design
- `/docs/specifications/` - Domain and feature specifications
- `/docs/reference/` - Operator catalogs and conceptual frameworks
- `/docs/guides/` - Implementation guides
- `/docs/examples/` - Working code examples
- `/docs/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records

## Root-Level Files (Retained)

The following files remain in the repository root for quick access:
- `README.md` - Project overview and getting started
- `STATUS.md` - Current implementation status
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
