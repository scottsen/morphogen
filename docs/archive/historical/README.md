# Historical Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded or is no longer relevant to the current state of the Kairo project but is preserved for historical reference.

## Archived Documents

### ROADMAP_v0.2.2_historical.md
**Original:** ROADMAP.md
**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** This roadmap was written when the project was still called "Creative Computation DSL" and planned a path from v0.2.2-mvp through v1.0.0 over a ~1 year timeline. The project has already evolved far beyond this plan (now at v0.10.0 with 26 domains implemented, 423+ operators, and 900+ tests). The roadmap is preserved here for historical context but should not be considered current planning.

### LANGUAGE_REFERENCE_v0.2.2_historical.md
**Original:** LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md
**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** This was the language reference for "Creative Computation DSL v0.2.2" which has been superseded by SPECIFICATION.md (v0.10.0). The v0.2.2 reference is preserved for understanding the evolution of the language but is no longer accurate for current Kairo.

### CHANGELIST_PHASE1_historical.md
**Original:** CHANGELIST_PHASE1.md
**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** Phase 1 planning document that is no longer relevant to current development. Preserved for historical reference only.

### RENAME_DECISION_SUMMARY_historical.md
**Original:** RENAME_DECISION_SUMMARY.md
**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** Documents a proposed rename from "Kairo" to "Morphogen" that has not been executed. Archived as this decision is on hold and should not be confused with current project status. The project remains "Kairo" as of v0.10.0.

### MORPHOGEN_RENAME_PREP_historical.md
**Original:** MORPHOGEN_RENAME_PREP.md
**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** Preparation document for the Kairo→Morphogen rename that has not been executed. Archived for the same reasons as RENAME_DECISION_SUMMARY_historical.md. The project remains "Kairo" as of v0.10.0.

## Why Archive Rather Than Delete?

These documents are archived rather than deleted because they:
1. Provide historical context for the evolution of the project
2. Document design decisions and rationale that may still be relevant
3. Show the progression from early concepts to current implementation
4. May contain useful ideas for future development

However, **do not rely on these documents for current project information** - they are historical snapshots only.
