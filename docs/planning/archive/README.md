# Archived Planning Documents

**Archive Date:** 2025-11-21
**Reason:** Consolidated into canonical [ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md](../ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md)

---

## Why These Documents Were Archived

These planning documents were created between November 15-19, 2025, during an intensive strategic planning period. They contained valuable insights but also had:

- **Overlapping scope** - Multiple documents covering similar territory
- **Conflicting priorities** - Different documents suggested different "top priorities"
- **Redundant content** - Same strategic analysis repeated across files
- **No clear hierarchy** - Unclear which document was authoritative

On November 21, 2025, all these documents were **consolidated into a single canonical roadmap** ([ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md](../ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md)) that synthesizes the best insights from each while providing clear, unambiguous priorities.

- File structure templates

**Superseded By:** ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md Phase 1-2 (weeks 1-6)

---

### STRATEGIC_NEXT_STEPS.md
**Date:** November 19, 2025 (Most recent before consolidation)
**Focus:** Strategic positioning and community growth

**Key Content:**
- 4-phase plan over 24 weeks
- Circuit domain as top priority
- Risk assessment and resource allocation tables
- Success metrics (short/medium/long-term)

**Why Valuable:**
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Clear success metrics framework
- Resource allocation percentages

**Superseded By:** ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md Strategic Priorities and Risk Assessment sections

---

### PROJECT_REVIEW_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md
**Date:** November 15, 2025
**Focus:** Comprehensive quality review

**Key Content:**
- Project grade: A (94/100)
- Code quality assessment by component
- 5-priority roadmap structure
- Detailed technical recommendations

**Why Valuable:**
- Baseline quality assessment
- Component-by-component analysis
- Competitive positioning analysis

**Superseded By:** ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md Current State Assessment section

---

### EXECUTION_PLAN_Q4_2025.md
**Date:** November 15, 2025
**Focus:** "Show → Validate → Build" approach

**Key Content:**
- Phase 1: Showcase & Validation (months 1-2)
- Emphasis on generating compelling outputs FIRST
- Detailed output quality standards (4K images, 1080p video, etc.)

**Why Valuable:**
- Output quality standards
- Marketing-first approach
- Specific showcase example priorities

**Superseded By:** ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md Phase 1 (Showcase Examples), complemented by active [SHOWCASE_OUTPUT_STRATEGY.md](../SHOWCASE_OUTPUT_STRATEGY.md)

**Note:** While archived, the "show first" philosophy is preserved in Phase 1 priorities of the new roadmap.

## What Changed in the Consolidation

### 🔄 Priority Reconciliation

**Before (conflicting):**
- NEXT_STEPS: "Start with Cellular Automata (quick win)"
- STRATEGIC_NEXT_STEPS: "Circuit domain is HIGHEST PRIORITY"
- EXECUTION_PLAN: "Generate showcase outputs FIRST, then build"

**After (consolidated):**
- **Week 1-3:** Circuit domain (highest strategic value) + Showcase examples prep
- **Week 4:** Cellular Automata (quick win after foundational work)
- **Rationale:** Circuit enables unique demos → showcase those demos → build momentum with quick wins

### 📊 Success Metrics Unified

All documents had different success metrics timelines. The new roadmap provides:
- **Short-term (3 months):** Clear technical and community goals
- **Medium-term (6 months):** Growth and adoption metrics
- **Long-term (12 months):** Impact and sustainability metrics

### 🎯 Single Source of Truth

Instead of 5 documents to check, contributors now have:
- **1 canonical roadmap** ([ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md](../ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md))
- **1 tactical complement** ([SHOWCASE_OUTPUT_STRATEGY.md](../SHOWCASE_OUTPUT_STRATEGY.md))

## When to Reference These Archives

**You should read these archived documents if:**

1. **Understanding historical context** - "Why did we decide X in November 2025?"
2. **Researching past strategic thinking** - "What alternatives were considered?"
3. **Reviewing evolution of priorities** - "How did the Circuit domain become top priority?"
4. **Learning from past planning** - "What worked/didn't work in our planning process?"

**You should NOT use these documents for:**

1. ❌ Current priorities - Use [ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md](../ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md)
2. ❌ Implementation guidance - Use active docs in `/docs/guides/`
3. ❌ Current status - Use `/STATUS.md` (root)

## Lessons Learned from This Consolidation

### What Worked Well

✅ **Multiple perspectives** - Each document brought unique insights
✅ **Comprehensive analysis** - Risk assessment, success metrics, resource allocation all thoroughly considered
✅ **Detailed planning** - Specific timelines, file structures, success criteria

### What Could Be Improved

⚠️ **Clear hierarchy** - Should have designated one doc as canonical from the start
⚠️ **Conflict resolution** - Different priorities should have been reconciled immediately
⚠️ **Update discipline** - When one doc changed, others became stale

### Going Forward

✨ **Single canonical roadmap** - One authoritative document updated as work progresses
✨ **Clear decision points** - Explicit review dates (every 2 weeks)
✨ **Complementary docs** - Supporting documents clearly labeled as tactical/reference
✨ **Archive promptly** - Move superseded docs to archive immediately
