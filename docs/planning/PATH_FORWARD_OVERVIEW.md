## The Vision

> **Morphogen will become the universal substrate for deterministic, multi-domain computation where professional domains that have never talked before can seamlessly compose through a single type system, scheduler, and compilation pipeline.**

### What This Means

**Today (v0.11.0):**
- 40 computational domains
- 900+ tests (all passing)
- Python runtime with NumPy backend
- MLIR compilation pipeline (6 dialects)
- Cross-domain composition working

**v1.0 (2026 Q2):**
- 50+ domains (adding Circuit, Fluid, Geometry, Symbolic)
- GPU acceleration (10-100x speedup)
- Symbolic + numeric execution
- Category theory optimization
- PyPI release, community adoption

**v2.0 (2027):**
- Complete professional ecosystem
- Multi-backend (CPU, GPU, FPGA, neuromorphic)
- Developer tools (LSP, VSCode, notebooks)
- Established in education and industry

---

## Immediate Action: Fresh Git Transition

### The Problem

Current state has naming inconsistency:
- Package name: `morphogen` ✅
- Git repository: `kairo` ❌
- Local directory: `/home/scottsen/src/projects/kairo` ❌
- Mixed references throughout codebase ❌

### The Solution

**Create fresh repository with unified naming:**

```bash
# 1. Create new repo on GitHub
New: git@github.com:scottsen/morphogen.git

# 2. Clean export (exclude git history)
rsync -av --exclude='.git' morphogen/ morphogen-fresh/

# 3. Final cleanup (replace remaining "kairo" references)
find . -type f -name "*.py" -o -name "*.md" \
  -exec sed -i 's/morphogen/morphogen/g' {} +

# 4. Initialize fresh git
cd morphogen-fresh
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:scottsen/morphogen.git
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Initial commit - Morphogen v0.11.0"
git push -u origin main

# 5. Archive old repository
# Keep as scottsen/kairo-archive for historical reference
```

**Timeline:** 1 week (mostly Day 1 for core migration)

**Details:** See [FRESH_GIT_STRATEGY.md](FRESH_GIT_STRATEGY.md)

## Strategic Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (v0.11.0 → v0.12.0) - Q4 2025

**Focus:** Solidify kernel boundaries and type system

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Type system hardening (rate checking, unit analysis, domain compatibility)
2. Operator registry completion (all 40 domains with metadata)
3. Coupling operators (Field↔Agent, Audio↔Circuit, Geometry↔Physics)
4. Documentation (domain boundaries, composability patterns)

**Success Criteria:**
- Type errors caught at compile time (not runtime)
- Clear "what composes with what" documentation
- All determinism tests passing

---

### Phase 2: Domain Expansion (v0.12.0 → v0.13.0) - Q1 2026

**Focus:** Add critical professional domains

**New Domains:**
1. **Circuit** ⭐ Priority 0 - Unlocks EE/analog audio markets
2. **Fluid** - Enables aerospace/automotive simulation
3. **Geometry** - CAD integration, TiaCAD-inspired references
4. **Symbolic** - Equation solving, SymPy integration

**Cross-Domain Examples:**
- Circuit guitar pedal → audio output
- J-tube geometry → fluid flow → thermal analysis
- Symbolic PDE → numeric field solver

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 2 professional "killer app" examples
- Performance acceptable for professional use
- Documentation for domain experts

---

### Phase 3: Language Evolution (v0.13.0 → v1.0.0) - Q2 2026

**Focus:** Language 1.0 with stable syntax and advanced features

**Language Features:**
1. Transform space tracking (type system knows time/frequency/space)
2. Category theory optimization (automatic fusion, verified composition)
3. Plugin system (user-defined domains)
4. Advanced types (dependent types, refinement types, effects)

**Success Criteria:**
- Stable language specification (no breaking changes post-1.0)
- Plugin system demonstrated with community domain
- PyPI release prepared

---

### Phase 4: Compilation & Performance (v1.0.0 → v1.5.0) - Q3-Q4 2026

**Focus:** Production-grade compilation and GPU acceleration

**Improvements:**
1. MLIR optimization (fusion, polyhedral, vectorization)
2. GPU acceleration (10-100x speedup for fields/agents)
3. JIT compilation (hot-path, adaptive, low-latency)
4. Multi-backend (CPU, GPU, FPGA, neuromorphic)

**Success Criteria:**
- Real-time audio on CPU (<5ms latency)
- Large simulations on multi-GPU
- JIT latency <100ms

---

### Phase 5: Ecosystem Maturity (v1.5.0 → v2.0.0) - 2027

**Focus:** Complete ecosystem with community and professional adoption

**Components:**
1. Developer tools (VSCode, LSP, notebooks)
2. Community infrastructure (marketplace, gallery, forum)
3. Professional integration (MATLAB bridge, Python interop, cloud)
4. Educational resources (book, courses, videos)

**Success Criteria:**
- 1000+ GitHub stars
- 50+ community domains
- 10+ companies in production
- Academic publications

## Architectural Principles

### The Three-Layer Architecture

```
FRONTENDS (Human Syntax)
   ↓ Graph IR
DOMAIN LIBRARIES (Specialized Operators)
   ↓ Operator Registry
KERNEL (Universal Abstractions)
```

**Key Rules:**
1. **Kernel is immutable post-1.0** - No breaking changes ever
2. **Domain libraries are clients** - They never modify kernel
3. **Frontends are translators** - Multiple frontends → same Graph IR

### The Four Pillars of Composability

1. **Type-Safe Composition** - Prevent invalid compositions at compile time
2. **Explicit Coupling** - Never implicit cross-domain connections
3. **Multirate Coordination** - Multiple rates with explicit sync points
4. **Deterministic Composition** - Composed systems inherit determinism

## Decision-Making Framework

### When to Add New Capability?

Evaluate through **Six Lenses:**

1. **Strategic Value** - Does it unlock professional use cases?
   - 🔥🔥🔥 Critical | 🔥🔥 High | 🔥 Medium | ❄️ Low

2. **Composability** - Does it compose cleanly?
   - ✅ Orthogonal | ⚠️ Minor Issues | 🚨 Complex | 🛑 Breaking

3. **Implementation Effort** - How much work?
   - 🟢 Low (<1 week) | 🟡 Medium (1-4w) | 🔴 High (1-3m) | ⚫ Extreme (>3m)

4. **Architectural Fit** - Where does it belong?
   - Kernel | Domain Library | Frontend

5. **Determinism** - Does it work in all profiles?
   - ✅ All | ⚠️ Repro/Live | 🚨 Live Only | 🛑 Breaking

6. **Community Alignment** - Do people need this?
   - 📊 User Requests | 📚 Academic | 🏭 Industry | 🎨 Creative

### Decision Matrix

| Proposal | Total Score | Decision |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 20-25 | ✅ ACCEPT (high priority) |
| 15-19 | ⏳ CONSIDER (evaluate alternatives) |
| 10-14 | ⚠️ DEFER (low priority, maybe later) |
| < 10 | ❌ REJECT (not worth it) |

**Example: Circuit Domain**
- Strategic: 🔥🔥🔥 (5)
- Composability: ✅ (5)
- Effort: 🔴 (-3)
- Arch Fit: Domain (5)
- Determinism: ✅ (5)
- Community: 🏭 (5)
- **Total: 22/25** → ✅ ACCEPT

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Composability First** - Every feature must compose cleanly
2. **Kernel Immutability** - Post-1.0, kernel API never breaks
3. **Explicit > Implicit** - Cross-domain coupling is always explicit
4. **Determinism by Default** - Nondeterminism requires annotation
5. **Document Everything** - No code merges without docs
6. **Test Comprehensively** - >90% coverage for all domains
7. **Respect Boundaries** - Kernel | Domains | Frontends stay separate
8. **Value Over Features** - Only add what enables real use cases

---

## Summary

This strategic plan provides:

1. **Immediate Action** - Fresh git transition (1 week)
2. **Technical Roadmap** - v0.11 → v0.12 → v0.13 → v1.0 → v2.0
3. **Architectural Principles** - Three layers, four pillars, standing decisions
4. **Decision Framework** - Six lenses for evaluating additions
5. **Prioritization** - P0-P3 based on value and effort
6. **Tracking System** - Documentation, ADRs, boundary points
7. **Success Metrics** - Quantitative (coverage, depth) and qualitative (adoption)

**The path forward is clear:**
- Start with fresh git (fix naming inconsistency)
- Solidify foundation (type system, boundaries)
- Add critical domains (Circuit, Fluid, Geometry)
- Reach language 1.0 (stable, professional)
- Grow ecosystem (community, tools, adoption)

**Morphogen is evolving toward its most capable, most composable form. These documents provide the roadmap.**
