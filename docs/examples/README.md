## Examples

### 🏎️ [Racing AI Training Pipeline: Neural Evolution Example](RACING-AI-PIPELINE.md)

**Status:** Design Document
**Domains:** Physics (Racing), Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm, Rendering, Telemetry, Recording
**Complexity:** Advanced
**Hardware:** GPU-optimized (RTX 3060 12GB target)

A complete racing AI training pipeline demonstrating how Morphogen's unified operator model enables seamless integration of physics simulation, neural network inference, genetic algorithms, and real-time visualization — all in one composable graph.

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Multi-domain composition (Physics + NN + GA + Rendering + Telemetry + Recording)
- GPU-accelerated parallel evaluation (64+ agents simultaneously)
- Genetic algorithm operators for neural network evolution
- Real-time visualization and debugging
- Deterministic training with perfect reproducibility
- 10-100× performance vs traditional Unity + Python approaches

**Key Insight:** This is **one of Morphogen's strongest use cases** because it merges traditionally-separate technologies (game engine physics, ML frameworks, custom GA code) into a single clean pipeline.

**Use Cases:**
- Autonomous racing AI
- Self-driving car simulation
- Drone flight controllers
- Robot navigation
- Game AI (any physics-based agent control)
- Reinforcement learning benchmarks

### 🔥 [J-Tube Fire Pit: Multi-Physics Engineering Example](J-TUBE-FIREPIT-MULTIPHYSICS.md)

**Status:** Design Document
**Domains:** Geometry, FluidNetwork, ThermalODE, FluidJet, CombustionLight
**Complexity:** Advanced

A complete multi-physics modeling example showing how Morphogen's operator graph paradigm extends from audio/graphics into engineering physics.

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Multi-physics system modeling (draft pressure, flow networks, thermal ODEs, jets, combustion)
- Cross-domain integration (Geometry → Fluid → Thermal → Combustion → Visualization)
- Reference-based composition (anchors, frames) for physical systems
- Design optimization workflow (parameter sweeps, objective search)
- New domain requirements (FluidNetwork, ThermalODE, FluidJet, CombustionLight)

**Key Insight:** The J-tube fire pit is basically a **little multi-physics engine in steel** — and Morphogen is exactly the kind of thing that wants to model that.

**Use Cases:**
- Fire pits (secondary combustion optimization)
- Mufflers (exhaust flow and back-pressure)
- HVAC systems (air duct networks)
- Heat exchangers (thermal-fluid coupling)
- Burners (combustion quality estimation)

### 🚀 [Kerbal Space Program: Multi-Domain Orbital Simulation Example](KERBAL-SPACE-PROGRAM-SIMULATION.md)

**Status:** Design Document
**Domains:** OrbitalMechanics, Aerodynamics, RocketEquation, PartsAssembly, PhysicsIntegration, FailureMechanics
**Complexity:** Advanced

Demonstrates how Morphogen can model KSP-style physics (orbital mechanics, aerodynamics, rocket staging, part assembly) and become a framework for aerospace simulations.

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Real-time multi-domain physics (orbits, aero, propulsion, structures)
- Part-based assembly system using operator graphs
- GPU-accelerated physics integration
- Level-of-detail physics switching (patched conics ↔ N-body)
- Cross-domain integration (Geometry/TiaCAD → Physics → Audio → Visualization)
- Educational platform for orbital mechanics and aerospace engineering

**Key Insight:** KSP's entire gameplay loop maps perfectly onto Morphogen's domain architecture — proving Morphogen can handle **real-time game physics** and **aerospace simulation**.

**Use Cases:**
- Spaceflight simulation games (KSP-like)
- Aerospace education (teaching orbital mechanics)
- Mission planning tools (trajectory optimization, launch windows)
- Satellite constellation design (Starlink, etc.)
- Research simulations (spacecraft dynamics)

**Unique Features:**
- Integration with J-tube combustion domain for realistic engine modeling
