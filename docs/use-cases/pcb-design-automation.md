# PCB Design Automation: Multi-Domain Physics Unification

**Target Audience**: Hardware engineers, PCB designers, electronics researchers, EDA tool developers

**Problem Class**: Electronics design → physical PCB layout → manufacturing constraints → EM behavior → circuit simulation → optimization

---

## Executive Summary

PCB layout is fundamentally a multi-domain physics problem spanning graph theory, geometry, electromagnetics, signal processing, circuit simulation, thermal physics, and manufacturing constraints. Current workflows require fragmented tool chains (KiCad/Altium → COMSOL/ANSYS → SPICE → Python → Simulink), with no unified semantic model. **Morphogen is uniquely positioned to treat PCB layout as a composable, multi-domain computational object**, enabling the first fully automated, physics-aware PCB design system based on symbolic reasoning + optimization + multi-domain composition.

## The Problem: PCB Layout Spans Too Many Disconnected Domains

### Current Tool Fragmentation

PCB layout is not just "placing components and routing traces." It simultaneously involves:

| Domain | Current Tool | Problem |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Graph theory** | Netlist editors | No physics awareness |
| **Geometry** | CAD layout tools | No EM awareness |
| **Electromagnetics** | COMSOL, ANSYS HFSS | Disconnected from layout |
| **Signal processing** | MATLAB, custom analysis | Post-hoc, not integrated |
| **Circuit simulation** | SPICE, LTspice | No geometry/EM coupling |
| **Thermal physics** | Thermal solvers | Separate simulation |
| **Optimization** | Custom scripts | Domain-specific heuristics |
| **Manufacturing** | DFM checkers | Rule-based, not physics-based |

### The Fragmentation Tax

Professional PCB workflows require:

```
Schematic editor (KiCad)
  → Netlist export
  → Place/route tool
  → Parasitic extraction (post-process)
  → EM solver (COMSOL/ANSYS) (separate simulation)
  → Circuit simulator (SPICE) (manual parasitic entry)
  → Signal analysis (MATLAB) (scripting glue)
  → Audio/system output (separate environment)
```

**Each arrow is a potential error source, data format mismatch, or semantic gap.**

Problems this creates:
- Manual iteration loops (layout → extract → simulate → redesign)
- No real-time physics feedback during routing
- Parasitic extraction is numeric-only and slow
- Can't "hear" or "see" circuit behavior during layout
- No unified optimization across all domains
- Different tools use incompatible coordinate systems, units, conventions

## How Morphogen Helps: Unified Multi-Domain PCB Model

### 1. Single Executable Model Spanning All Domains

In Morphogen, PCB layout becomes **one typed computation**:

```morphogen
use circuit, geometry, field, optimization, audio

let board = pcb {
    components: [...],
    nets: [...],
    stackup: [...],
}

let em_field = board.to_em_field()
let circuit_model = board.to_circuit(em_field)
let audio_output = circuit_model.to_audio(input_signal)
```

**This collapses six tools into one pipeline** with:
- Type-safe domain transitions
- Deterministic execution
- Real-time feedback
- No data format conversions
- Unified coordinate system

### 2. Symbolic + Numeric Parasitic Extraction

**Key Innovation**: Simple parasitics are symbolically solvable:
- Straight trace inductance: `L = μ₀μᵣ(l/w)`
- Parallel trace capacitance: `C = ε₀εᵣ(w·l/d)`
- Microstrip impedance: `Z₀ = (87/√(εᵣ+1.41)) · ln(5.98h/(0.8w+t))`

Morphogen can:
1. Generate symbolic expressions for L, C, R from geometry
2. Insert them directly into the circuit graph
3. Only fall back to numeric EM simulation when needed

**Why this matters**: Bridges the long-standing gap between SPICE (numeric-only) and EM solvers (numeric-only). No other tool has a symbolic engine coupled to both geometry and circuit domains.

Example workflow:
```morphogen
// Symbolic path for simple geometries
let trace_L = symbolic_inductance(trace_geometry)
let trace_C = symbolic_capacitance(trace_geometry, substrate)

// Numeric fallback for complex structures
let via_Z = numeric_em_solve(via_structure)
```

### 3. Category-Theoretic Routing Optimization

Routing is fundamentally:
- Composition of geometric transformations
- Subject to topological constraints

Morphogen's functorial semantics enable **globally optimal routing transformations**:

```morphogen
route differential_pair(clk_p, clk_n, length_match=5mm)
```

The compiler can apply algebraic rewrites:
- Coalesce segments (path simplification)
- Eliminate unnecessary vias (graph reduction)
- Enforce symmetry (geometric constraints)
- Fuse constraints with operations (constraint propagation)

**Existing routers use heuristics, not mathematical equivalences.**
Morphogen introduces **sound, algebraic layout optimization**.

### 4. Circuit → Audio Coupling: Hear Your Layout

**No other EDA tool lets you directly hear the effect of PCB geometry.**

Example use case: Guitar effects pedal design

```morphogen
let pcb = load_pcb("tube_screamer_layout.morphogen")
let em = pcb.to_em_field()
let circuit = pcb.to_circuit(em)
audio.play(circuit.process(guitar_input))
```

You can **immediately hear**:
- Parasitic inductance effects
- Trace coupling (crosstalk)
- Ground plane quality
- Via stub resonances
- Loop area (hum and noise)

**A slight change in ground plane geometry? You hear the hum difference.**

This enables:
- Real-time audio feedback during layout
- Direct A/B comparison of layout variants
- Intuitive understanding of EM → circuit → audio coupling
- Automated optimization for audio quality

### 5. Multi-Physics During Routing

Thermal, EM, mechanical stress, and manufacturability constraints can run **continuously during routing**:

```morphogen
flow(dt=0.1) {
    temp = heat_flow(board)
    em = solve_em(board)
    stress = mechanical_stress(board)
    drc = check_manufacturing(board)

    optimize(board, [temp, em, stress, drc])
}
```

This is exactly what ANSYS, COMSOL, KiCad, and SPICE **fail to do together**.

Morphogen can optimize layout with real-time multi-physics feedback:
- Thermal hotspots guide copper pour placement
- EM coupling guides trace separation
- Mechanical stress avoids fragile geometries
- DFM rules integrated into optimization cost function

## What No Other Tool Can Do

### ✅ Unified Circuit + Geometry + EM + Audio Pipeline
**One language, one type system, one execution model**

No tool chain today connects:
- Schematic → layout → EM → circuit → audio
- in a deterministic, type-safe, compositional way

### ✅ Symbolic Parasitic Extraction
**Closed-form L, C, R expressions for simple geometries**

SPICE: numeric only
HFSS: numeric only
Wolfram: symbolic but domain-disconnected
CAD tools: no symbolic engine

Morphogen: `symbolic(EM(geometry(board))) → circuit → audio`

### ✅ Category-Theoretic Router
**Mathematically sound layout transformations, not heuristics**

Existing routers: greedy, unaware of physics, no formal semantics
Morphogen: functorial composition, algebraic rewrites, global optimization

### ✅ Real-Time Multi-Physics Feedback
**Thermal + EM + mechanical + DFM during routing**

Existing flows: separate simulations, manual iteration
Morphogen: unified scheduler, continuous constraint satisfaction

### ✅ Deterministic Hardware Simulation
**Reproducible across machines, platforms, runs**

Most EM/thermal solvers: nondeterministic (GPU, threading, floating-point)
Morphogen: bit-identical results, scientific reproducibility

### ✅ Intent-Driven Layout
**Optimize for behavior, not just DRC compliance**

```morphogen
optimize(board)
  with cost {
      minimize(trace_length(board))
      + minimize(em_noise(board))
      + minimize(clock_skew(board))
      + minimize(thermal_gradient(board))
      + penalize(dfm_violations(board))
  }
```

This is **the first system capable of optimizing PCB layout for multi-physics objectives**, not just routing completion.

## Research Directions Enabled

### 1. Automated PCB Design from High-Level Specification

Morphogen could enable:

```morphogen
design guitar_pedal {
    input: Guitar(impedance=1M)
    output: Amplifier(impedance=10k)
    response: overdrive(gain=20dB, tone=bright)
    constraints: {
        size: (100mm, 60mm)
        cost: < $5 BOM
        emi: < -40dB @ 1MHz
    }
}
```

The system automatically:
- Selects circuit topology
- Places components

**This is 40 years of EDA research compressed into one system.**

### 2. ML-Guided Layout with Physics-in-the-Loop

Morphogen's deterministic multi-physics enables:
- Reinforcement learning for routing with EM/thermal rewards
- Differentiable PCB optimization
- Physics-informed neural networks for parasitic prediction
- Generative models for layout synthesis

### 3. Cross-Domain PCB Design Patterns

Discover reusable patterns:
- "Low-noise audio ground plane topology"
- "High-speed differential pair with via compensation"
- "Thermal-aware power plane segmentation"

Morphogen can formally verify and optimize these patterns across domains.

### 4. Interactive Physics-Aware Layout

Real-time layout with live feedback:
- Drag component → see thermal/EM impact instantly
