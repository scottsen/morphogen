# Morphogen

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

> *Where computation becomes composition*

**Morphogen** is a universal, deterministic computation platform that unifies domains that have never talked to each other before: **audio synthesis meets physics simulation meets circuit design meets geometry meets optimization** — all in one type system, one scheduler, one language.

## Why Morphogen Exists

Current tools force you to:
- Export CAD → import to FEA → export mesh → import to CFD → manually couple results
- Write audio DSP in C++ → physics in Python → visualization in JavaScript
- Bridge domains with brittle scripts and incompatible data formats

**Morphogen eliminates this fragmentation.** Model a guitar string's physics, synthesize its sound, optimize its geometry, and visualize the result — all in the same deterministic execution environment.

---

## Part of the Semantic Infrastructure Lab

**Morphogen** is a production component of the [Semantic Infrastructure Lab (SIL)](https://github.com/semantic-infrastructure-lab/sil) — building the semantic substrate for intelligent systems.

**Role in the Semantic OS:**
- **Layer 2:** Domain Module (audio, physics, circuits, geometry)
- **Layer 4:** Deterministic Engine (MLIR compilation, reproducible execution)

**SIL Principles Applied:**
- ✅ **Clarity** — Explicit domain semantics (audio, field, agent, geometry)
- ✅ **Simplicity** — Four core operations unify all domains
- ✅ **Composability** — Domains compose via typed connections
- ✅ **Correctness** — Type system enforces units, rates, constraints
- ✅ **Verifiability** — Deterministic execution enables reproducibility

## Two Surfaces, One Kernel

Morphogen presents **two human-friendly faces** powered by a single semantic kernel:

- **Morphogen.Audio** — Declarative language for compositional audio, physics, and multi-domain scenes
- **RiffStack** — Live performance environment for real-time interaction and improvisation

Both compile to the same Graph IR, share the same operator registry, and guarantee deterministic, reproducible results.

> 📐 **Deep Dive**: See [docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/) for the complete stack design (kernel, frontends, Graph IR, MLIR compilation)

## What Makes Morphogen Different

**Cross-Domain Composition**
- Audio synthesis + fluid dynamics + circuit simulation in the same program
- Type-safe connections between domains (e.g., field → agent force, geometry → audio impulse response)
- Single execution model handles multiple rates (audio @ 48kHz, control @ 60Hz, physics @ 240Hz)

**Deterministic by Design**
- Bitwise-identical results across runs, platforms, and GPU vendors
- Explicit RNG seeding, sample-accurate event scheduling
- Three profiles: `strict` (bit-exact), `repro` (deterministic FP), `live` (low-latency)

**Transform-First Thinking**
- FFT, STFT, wavelets, DCT as first-class operations
- Domain changes (time ↔ frequency, space ↔ k-space) are core primitives
- Uniform transform API across all domains

**Production-Grade Compilation**
- MLIR-based compiler with 6 custom dialects
- Lowers to optimized CPU/GPU code via LLVM
- Field operations, agents, audio DSP, temporal execution all compile to native code

## Sister Project: Philbrick

**Morphogen** (software) and **[Philbrick](https://github.com/scottsen/philbrick)** (hardware) are **two halves of one vision** — modular computation in different substrates.

| Aspect | Morphogen (Digital) | Philbrick (Analog/Hybrid) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Digital simulation of continuous phenomena | Physical embodiment of continuous dynamics |
| **Primitives** | Streams, fields, transforms | Sum, integrate, nonlinearity, events |
| **Safety** | Type system (domain/rate/units) | Pin contracts (voltage/impedance/latency) |
| **Execution** | Multirate deterministic scheduler | Latency-aware routing fabric |
| **Philosophy** | **Computation = composition** | **Computation = composition** |

### The Bridge

- **Design in Morphogen** → Simulate and optimize continuous-time systems
- **Build in Philbrick** → Physical modules implementing the same primitives
- **Validate Together** → Software and hardware mirror each other

Both platforms share the same four core operations (sum, integrate, nonlinearity, events) and the same compositional philosophy. They will eventually compile to each other.

## Cross-Domain in Action

Here's what sets Morphogen apart — domains working together seamlessly:

```morphogen
# Couple fluid dynamics → acoustics → audio synthesis
use fluid, acoustics, audio

# Simulate airflow in a 2-stroke engine exhaust
@state flow : FluidNetwork1D = engine_exhaust(length=2.5m, diameter=50mm)
@state acoustic : AcousticField1D = waveguide_from_flow(flow)

flow(dt=0.1ms) {
    # Fluid dynamics: pressure pulses from engine
    flow = flow.advance(engine_pulse(t), method="lax_wendroff")

    # Couple to acoustics: flow → sound propagation
    acoustic = acoustic.couple_from_fluid(flow, impedance_match=true)

    # Synthesize audio from acoustic field
    let exhaust_sound = acoustic.to_audio(mic_position=1.5m)

    # Real-time output
    audio.play(exhaust_sound)
}
```

**One program. Three domains. Zero glue code.**

See [docs/use-cases/2-stroke-muffler-modeling.md](docs/use-cases/2-stroke-muffler-modeling.md) for the complete example.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottsen/morphogen.git
cd morphogen
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Program

Create `hello.kairo` (Morphogen source files use `.kairo` extension):

```morphogen
# hello.kairo - Heat diffusion

use field, visual

@state temp : Field2D<f32 [K]> = random_normal(
    seed=42,
    shape=(128, 128),
    mean=300.0,
    std=50.0
)

const KAPPA : f32 [m²/s] = 0.1

flow(dt=0.01, steps=500) {
    temp = diffuse(temp, rate=KAPPA, dt, iterations=20)
    output colorize(temp, palette="fire", min=250.0, max=350.0)
}
```

Run it:

```bash
morphogen run hello.kairo
```

## Language Overview

### Temporal Model

Morphogen programs describe time-evolving systems through `flow` blocks:

```morphogen
flow(dt=0.01, steps=1000) {
    # Execute this block 1000 times with timestep 0.01
    temp = diffuse(temp, rate=0.1, dt)
    output colorize(temp, palette="fire")
}
```

### State Management

Persistent variables are declared with `@state`:

```morphogen
@state vel : Field2D<Vec2<f32>> = zeros((256, 256))
@state agents : Agents<Particle> = alloc(count=1000)

flow(dt=0.01) {
    vel = advect(vel, vel, dt)      # Updates vel for next step
    agents = integrate(agents, dt)   # Updates agents for next step
}
```

### Deterministic Randomness

All randomness is explicit via RNG objects:

```morphogen
@state agents : Agents<Particle> = alloc(count=100, init=spawn_random)

fn spawn_random(id: u32, rng: RNG) -> Particle {
    return Particle {
        pos: rng.uniform_vec2(min=(0, 0), max=(100, 100)),
        vel: rng.normal_vec2(mean=(0, 0), std=(1, 1))
    }
}
```

### Physical Units

Types can carry dimensional information:

```morphogen
temp : Field2D<f32 [K]>           # Temperature in Kelvin
pos : Vec2<f32 [m]>               # Position in meters
vel : Vec2<f32 [m/s]>             # Velocity in m/s
force : Vec2<f32 [N]>             # Force in Newtons

# Unit checking at compile time
dist : f32 [m] = 10.0
time : f32 [s] = 2.0
speed = dist / time               # OK: f32 [m/s]

# ERROR: cannot mix incompatible units
x = dist + time                   # ERROR: m + s is invalid
```

## Examples

### Fluid Simulation (Navier-Stokes)

```morphogen
use field, visual

@state vel : Field2D<Vec2<f32 [m/s]>> = zeros((256, 256))
@state density : Field2D<f32> = zeros((256, 256))

const VISCOSITY : f32 = 0.001
const DIFFUSION : f32 = 0.0001

flow(dt=0.01, steps=1000) {
    # Advect velocity
    vel = advect(vel, vel, dt, method="maccormack")

    # Diffuse velocity (viscosity)
    vel = diffuse(vel, rate=VISCOSITY, dt, iterations=20)

    # Project (incompressibility)
    vel = project(vel, method="cg", max_iterations=50)

    # Advect and diffuse density
    density = advect(density, vel, dt)
    density = diffuse(density, rate=DIFFUSION, dt)

    # Dissipation
    density = density * 0.995

    # Visualize
    output colorize(density, palette="viridis")
}
```

### Reaction-Diffusion (Gray-Scott)

```morphogen
use field, visual

@state u : Field2D<f32> = ones((256, 256))
@state v : Field2D<f32> = zeros((256, 256))

const Du : f32 = 0.16
const Dv : f32 = 0.08
const F : f32 = 0.060
const K : f32 = 0.062

flow(dt=1.0, steps=10000) {
    # Gray-Scott reaction
    let uvv = u * v * v
    let du_dt = Du * laplacian(u) - uvv + F * (1.0 - u)
    let dv_dt = Dv * laplacian(v) + uvv - (F + K) * v

    u = u + du_dt * dt
    v = v + dv_dt * dt

    # Visualize
    output colorize(v, palette="viridis")
}
```
